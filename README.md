# Interests
A list of the various interests of mine. I'm constantly finding new stuff I like, so this section may be updated frequently.
### Sports
Recently, I've began striving to watch more sports as I've never been too interested in it until this year. **Just a note: I'm still gaining knowledge about these sports, so forgive any possible confusion.**
#### (American) Football
Football is really the only sport I have a real deep history on, especially for the NFL.

**National Football League (NFL)**

Ever since I was young, the team I've always supported is for sure the San Francisco 49ers. I've rooted for them for MANY years by this point, and I don't plan on switching my primary NFL team which I root for.

**College Football (NCAAF)**

As of March 2023 I still have yet to properly watch a college football game, but because of other college sports I'm likely going to primarily watch the Big Ten conference, and specifically the Iowa Hawkeyes.

**XFL/USFL**

These leagues are grouped because as of me writing this (March 4, 2023) I haven't properly watched a game from either league. In the future I may dive deeper into my favorites, but currently I can't.

#### Basketball
Basketball is a sport which I am currently still learning, but it's pretty safe to say it might be my favorite, or at least a close 2nd behind American football. I have really grown to like it, as it feels fast-paced but also exciting too.

**NBA**

Currently I'm gonna support the Timberwolves, but previously I was a fan of the Celtics. In fact, the 2022 NBA Finals was likely the first NBA game I actually fully watched and was interested in. Around that time, I also discovered that I enjoyed watching basketball too!

**College Basketball (NCAAM/NCAAW)**

Once again, still trying to get a grasp on the teams and everything, but I simply have to support the Iowa Hawkeyes for both college basketball leagues.
